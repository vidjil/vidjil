This CHANGELOG concerns the Docker images of vidjil.
We publish here notes to help to update these images.
See <http://www.vidjil.org/doc/server>

   - New cron job `check_queued.py` to reset workers.
     Please perform a `git pull` in the `docker` repository.

   - New variable in defs.py: `LDAP` (set it to False by default).
     Please restart the `workers` container after modifying it.
   - Database migration: if you encounter a `Duplicate column name 'pre_process_file'` MySQL error, then you should drop the corresponding column in the table : `ALTER TABLE sequence_file DROP COLUMN pre_process_file;`. As this is a new column, dropping it won't have any consequences.
