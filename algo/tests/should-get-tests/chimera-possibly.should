$ The two reads are detected by the KmerSegmenter as TRG
1: found 2 windows in 2 reads
1: TRG .* -> .* 2 .* 2

$ However, after FineSegmenter, one of the reads is not designated
1: >clone.* TRG SEG
1: >clone.* Possibly TRG .* UNSEG

$ The first read is designated as V1-J1
1:TRGV1.*/NNNN/.*TRGJ1

$ The other read can not be safely designated, it is identified as 'possibly TRG' and a warning is raised
1:Possibly TRG
1:W68

$ The .vidjil file also reports the 'not designated' sequence
2: "germline": "TRG"
