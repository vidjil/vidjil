## Pipelines

Usual tests should pass, but also:
* [ ] Each creation/modification of function is described in code
* [ ] Unit tests should be updated
* [ ] (browser/server) cypress tests if relevant
* [ ] (deploy the client on app)

## Documentation

* [ ] New features are described in `doc/changelog`
* [ ] If needed, documentation is updated
* [ ] Breaking changes (and needed configuration changes) are understood, justified and describe in documentation
* [ ] deploy the doc: click on `deploy_doc`
* [ ] Move mr/issue in current milestone
