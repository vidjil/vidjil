## Pipelines

Usual tests should pass, but also:
* [ ] Each creation/modification of function is described in code
* [ ] Tests should be updated
* [ ] (browser/server) cypress tests should be updated if relevant
* [ ] (deploy the client on app)

## Documentation

* [ ] New features are described in `doc/CHANGELOG` or `doc/CHANGELOG.web`
* [ ] If needed, documentation is updated
* [ ] Breaking changes (and needed configuration changes) are understood, justified and describe in documentation
* [ ] Tag MR/issues in a milestone, current or next
