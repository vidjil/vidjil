# Encoding clones with V(D)J recombinations with `.vidjil` files

The following [.json](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format (2016b) allows to
encode a set of clones with V(D)J immune recombinations,
possibly with user annotations.

In Vidjil, this format is used by both the `.analysis` and the `.vidjil` files.
The `.vidjil` file represents the actual data on clones (and that can
reach megabytes, or even more), usually produced by processing reads by some RepSeq software.
(for example with detailed information on the 100 or 1000 top clones).
The `.analysis` file describes customizations done by the user
(or by some automatic pre-processing) on the Vidjil web application. The web application
can load or save such files (and possibly from/to the patient/sample database).
It is intended to be very small (a few kilobytes).
All settings in the `.analysis` file override the settings that could be
present in the `.vidjil` file.

# What is a clone ?

There are several definitions of what may be a clonotype,
depending on different RepSeq software or studies.
This format accept any kind of definition:
Clones are identified by a `id` string that may be an arbitrary identifier such as `clone-072a`.
Software computing clones may choose some relevant identifiers:

  - `CGAGAGGTTACTATGATAGTAGTGGTTATTACGGGGTAGGGCAGTACTAC`, Vidjil algorithm, 50 nt window centered on the CDR3
  - `CARPRDWNTYYYYGMDVW`, a CDR3 AA sequence
  - `CARPRDWNTYYYYGMDVW IGHV3-11*00 IGHJ6*00`, a CDR3 AA sequence with additional V/J gene information (MiXCR)
  - the 'clone sequence' as computed by the ARReST in `.clntab` files (processed by `fuse.py`)
  - see also 'IMGT clonotype (AA) or (nt)'

# Examples

## `.vidjil` file – one sample

This is an almost minimal `.vidjil` file, describing clones in one sample.
The `seg` element is optional: clones without `seg` elements will be shown on the grid with '?/?'.
The `_average_read_length` is also optional, but allows to plot GENSCAN-like plots more precisely than getting only the length of the sequence.
All other elements are required. The `reads.germlines` list can have only one element the case of data on a unique locus.
There is here one clone on the `TRG` locus with a designation (`name`) `TRGV5*01 5/CC/0 TRGJ1*02`.
Note that this `name` is just used to name the clone.
The actual values used for X- and Y- axis in the V/J grid plot are `seg.5.name` and `seg.3.name` fields.
Note that other elements could be added by some program (such as `tag`, to identify some clones,
or `clusters`, to further cluster some clones, see below).

}
```

## `.vidjil` file – several related samples

This a `.vidjil` file obtained by merging with `fuse.py` two `.vidjil` files corresponding to two samples.
Clones that are from different files but that have a same `id` are gathered (see 'What is a clone?', above).
It is the responsibility of the program generating the initial `.vidjil` files to choose these `id` to
do a correct gathering.

## `.analysis` file

This file reflects the annotations a user could have done within the Vidjil web application or some other tool.
She has manually set sample names (`names`), tagged (`tag`, `tags`), named (`name`) and clustered (`clusters`)
some clones, and added external data (`data`).

The `order` field defines the order in which order the points should be
considered. In that case we should first consider the second point (whose `name`
is *fu1)* and the point to be considered in second should be the first one in
the file (whose `name` is *diag*).

The `clusters` field indicate clones (by their `id`) that have been further clustered.
Usually, these clones were defined in a related `.vidjil` file (as *clone2* and *clone3*,
see the `.vidjil` file in the previous section). If these clones do not exist, the clusters are
just ignored. The first item of the cluster is considered as the
representative clone of the cluster.

# Detailed specification

## Generic information for traceability \[required\]

``` javascript

## Statistics: the `reads` element \[.vidjil only, required\]

The number of analyzed reads (`segmented`) may be higher than the sum of the read number of all clones,
when one choose to report only the 'top' clones (`-t` option for fuse).

``` javascript
{
    "total" : [],          // total number of reads per sample (with samples.number elements)
    "segmented" : [],      // number of analyzed/segmented reads per sample (with samples.number elements)
    "germline" : {         // number of analyzed/segmented reads per sample/germline (with samples.number elements)

    }
}
```

## `samples` element \[required\]

``` javascript

## `clones` list, with read count, tags, V(D)J designation and other sequence features

Each element in the `clones` list describes properties of a clone.

In a `.vidjil` file, this is the main part, describing all clones.
In the `.analysis` file, this section is intended to describe some specific clones.

``` javascript

                    // (should match a germline defined in germline/germline.data)

   "name": "",      // clone custom name [optional]
                    // (the default name, in .vidjil, is computed from V/D/J information)

                    //  such as standard/spikes or know patient clones)

   "tag": "",       // tag id from 0 to 7 (see below) [optional]

   "expected": ""   // expected abundance of this clone (between 0 and 1) [optional]
                    // this will create a normalization option in the

                    // Any feature to be highlighted in the sequence.
                    // All those fields are optional (though some minor feature may not properly work in the client)
                    //  - "start"/"stop" : positions on the clone sequence (starting at 1)

## `distributions`: providing statistics on full clonal populations

In some situations, one would like to represent whole distributions of clones
according to "axes" such as V/J distribution or length.
It is possible to specify in the `.vidjil` file such `"distributions"`
without detailing the full list of clones, hence keeping a relatively small file
and enabling fast post-processing or visualizations.

In the example below, 5 clones (totaling 6 reads) have a length of 223.
Distributions can be on several axes, like both V/J (here seg3/seg5).

``` javascript
{
    "distributions":
    {
        "keys": ["clones", "reads"],
        "repertoires": {
            "sample_42": [
                {
                    "axes": ["lenSeqAverage"],
                    "values": { "223": [5, 6], "232": [1, 7], "260": [5, 20] }
                },
                {
                    "axes": ["seg3", "seg5"],
                    "values": {
                         "IGHJ3": {"IGHV4-39": [5, 20]},
                         "IGHJ4": {"IGHV3-23": [1, 7], "IGHV3-64": [1, 1]},
                         "IGHJ6": {"IGHV1-24": [2, 3], "IGHV1-8": [2, 2]}
                       }
                }]
              }
       }
     }
   }
```

Distributions from a `.vidjil` files can be computed by `tools/fuse.py`, 
giving the desired list of distributions
through the `-d` option. For the above example, run:

```bash
python fuse.py -d lenSeqAverage -d seg3,seg5 sample_42.vidjil
```

The command `fuse.py -l` yields the list of available axes,
but currently only `lenSeqAverage` and `seq3,seq5` are supported.
Adding axes can be done trough in `get_values()` in `tools/fuse.py`.
Note that axes should also be added to `browser/js/axes.js` to be displayed in the client.


## `germlines` list \[optional\]\[work in progress, to be documented\]

extend the `germline.data` default file with a custom germline

``` javascript
"germlines" : {
    "custom" : {
        "shortcut": "B",
        "5": ["TRBV.fa"],
        "4": ["TRBD.fa"],
        "3": ["TRBJ.fa"]
    }
}
```

## Further clustering of clones: the `clusters` list \[optional\]

Each element in the 'clusters' list describe a list of clones that are 'merged'.
In the web application, it will be still possible to see them or to unmerge them.
The first clone of each line is used as a representative for the cluster.

## `data` list \[optional\]\[work in progress, to be documented\]

Each element in the `data` list is a list of values (of size samples.number)
showing additional data for each sample, as for example qPCR levels or spike information.

In the browser, it will be possible to display these data and to normalize
against them (not implemented now).

## Tagging some clones: `tags` list \[optional\]

The `tags` list describe the custom tag names as well as tags that should be hidden by default.
