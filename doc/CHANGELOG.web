This changelog concerns the Vidjil web application, client and server.
As we are using continuous integration and deployment, some features are pushed on our servers between these releases.

## 2021-05-05

Improve analysis
* New sequence aligner, flexible display of nucleotide/AA sequences, VDJ, CDR, and FR features
* New detection of primer positions and computation of interpolated length (BIOMED-2 and EuroClonality-NGS primer sets)
* New report and axis, detailed cause of non-productivity

Improve ergonomy
* Better handling of saved settings (color by, naming choices)
* New button to open one sample with its analysis from the patient/sample database
* Color settings are used in report

Improve quality testing
* The tutorial is better tested, including interactions with the sample database

Other points
* Fix disgracious position in graph
* Add more explicit warning about healthcare compliance
* Fix logout error for some instances (app.vidjil.org)

## 2020-12-09

* Possibility to create at once multiple patients/runs/sets by pasting data from the clipboard

Add new warnings
* Add warnings when the server is not approved for healthcare data (!813, see >vidjil.org/doc/healthcare>)
* Add warning to show variation in V(D)J designation or productivity prediction between samples (#4566, #4578)

Improve quality testing
* The tutorial is now tested, step by step (#2880)

Improve internal database usage
* Refactor some queries of the database. Filtering and searches are now way faster.
  Note that the basic query may be a little bit slower. (#3169)

Other points
* Fix error on clusterBy (#4495)
* Many other bug fixes

## 2020-07-13

Better study full repertoires
* Genescan-like distributions on the full repertoire (preset 4) (!595, !551, !525)
* New configuration to export the full list of clones in AIRR format (with no clone limitation)

Clone list
* New options to lock clone sorting (!630, !564)

Time graph, working with several samples
* Better options to hide/show samples in the time graph (!565)
* Possibility to hide clones not present in the current sample (!564)
* New design of curves

Other points
* Better organization of configurations (!627)
* Free text zone in report
* Read merger: Flash instead of PEAR (#3911)
* Many bug fixes

## 2020-01
	* New behaviour of graphList (#4105); Now you can hide/show sample directly from a list with checkbox, and button for automation
	  You can also hidding them by double clicking on their label in the timeline graphic.

## 2017-10
	* New tag mechanism to store/filter default or custom metadata on patient/runs/sets #2170 #2172 #2683
	* Added a second grid view when there is only one sample #2244
	* New experimental feature to add germline genes in the segmenter #1925
	* New axes with number of deleted nucleotides #2506
	* Better test process (jshint, nightmare.js) #2272 #2273
	* Moved continuous integration to Gitlab CI (.gitlab-ci.yml)
	* New and updated unit and functional tests
	* Bugs corrected: Fasta export #2628, values on axes #2540, spurious data #2598, timeout in segmenter #2559...

2017-05-23  Release %"Web 2017.05"
	* Refactor of the axes for the grid and bar plots. New features are forthcoming #1471 #1763 #2175
	* New option to download output files #2141 #2405
	* Refactor of the sequence view. The sequence view will soon be able to display V(D)J germline genes.
	* New setting to display shorter clone names (by default, allele is hidden when it is *01) #1679
	* Renamed "merge" to "cluster", more consistent clustering options, including undo #2336 #2335
	* New keyboard shortcuts on some browsers #1227
