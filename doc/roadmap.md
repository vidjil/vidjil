# Roadmap

The development of the Vidjil platform is tracked with [gitlab](http://gitlab.vidjil.org).
As of 2021, there are more than 1500 [open issues](http://gitlab.vidjil.org/issues),
but also... more than 2000 closed issues.
Issues can be either in English or in French.

This roadmap is focused on user-facing features, even if many items involve more backend changes,
and links to actual issues in our gitlab with more technical content.
The roadmap is regularly updated and discussed with our users and collaborators,
in particular at each Vidjil Workshop.

Items generally go through the following stages:

 - **Research**, **Evaluation**: discussion on the issues and on the strategy.
    Take days, months... or years.
    This is the default stage for all items that are not currently developed or scheduled for development.
 - **Development**: software, test and documentation engineering.
    Going to this stage (or schedule to going here) means that we identified enough time to work on it.
    Take between weeks and months
 - **Beta**: available for selected users, feedback with these users. Contact us if you are interested.
    Usually 1 to 3 months
 - **Availability**: available for everyone, with appropriate documentation, part of the current [release](releases.md).

These stages can be 
pending and not scheduled (no icon), 
pending and scheduled (‚è≥), 
in progress (üöß), 
or finished (‚úÖ).

     + **Availibility : 2020** ‚úÖ  (creation with `.csv`)
     + Batch upload
 
 - Provide statistics given a set on samples #3171

## Improved and extended analysis of some recombinations

These points are not in the roadmap with fixed dates.

 - Extend set of recombinations
 - Find generalized recombinations, even unexpected #1400 #2818
 - Work on clone phylogenies
 - Work on noisy data, such as third-generation sequencers

Perspectives depends on collaboration.
These points are *ongoing research* üöß in the Bonsai team with selected collaborators.
For some of these points, we are open to new partners.
They often imply core algorithmic work on Vidjil-algo, often combined with updates on the web application.
Contact us if you are interested and/or if you have/plan to have such data.
