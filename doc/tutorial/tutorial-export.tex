\subsection{Checking VDJ designations with other software}
For some studies, VDJ designations are very important.
In the list and in the sequence panel, those designations are written in their
short form.

\question{Put the mouse cursor over a clone. In the status bar (between the
  grid and the sequence panel), the complete designation appears.}

We can double check this designation with other popular software.
\question{Select a few clones.}
\marginpar{This requires an internet connection.}
\question{Click on the down triangle, which is right to \com{IMGT/V-QUEST}. The
  clone sequences are sent to IMGT/V-QUEST.}
\question{Then tick the checkbox 5'V/D/3'J. In the sequence panel the boundaries of
  the V(D)J genes as computed by IMGT/V-QUEST are underlined.}
  
Note that data returned by IMGT/V-QUEST is available by clicking on the \textit{i} icon of analyzed clones,
enabling you to compare the annotations made by the original software and by IMGT/V-QUEST. 

\question{You can also directly send the sequences to IMGT/V-QUEST or IgBlast
  by clicking the corresponding buttons. This opens a new page with the
  corresponding websites.}

\bigskip

It may happen the software makes a mistake in the VDJ designation.
In such a case you're very welcome to report us the problem
and we will try to improve the designation algorithm.

\question{Go in the \com{Help} menu and click on \com{get
    support}. It opens your mailer with a pre-composed email
    describing the data you are on as well as the clones you selected.}.

Even if you do not use the \com{get support} button, it's a good practise
to send the complete address showing in your web browser, such
as  \url{http://app.vidjil.org/?set=3241&config=39&plot=v,size,bar},
when you want to discuss with colleagues or with us your data or your analyses.

\bigskip

Suppose that you would like to change the VDJ designation shown on the web application.
\question{Click on the \textit{i} icon in the list of clones for the clone you
  want to change the designation. In the segmentation part, click the edit
  button. Choose what you would like to modify.}

Beware: the modifications you made (name changes, clusters, clone
tagging, sample reordering\dots) will \textbf{not} be automatically saved. You have to save
your changes by yourself either by clicking on \com{save patient} in the top left menu (where the
``patient'' name is written) or by using the \texttt{Ctrl+S} keyboard
shortcut.
For this demonstration data, you cannot save your changes as you do not have
the rights to modify this patient.

\subsection{Exporting data}

\question{In the export menu, generate printable reports by clicking on both entries starting with \com{export
  report}. What differs between both?}

\question{Select some clones and then, in the export menu, choose \com{export
  fasta}. What happens?}

\question{Open the \com{import/export} menu, and click on \com{export csv}.
The resulting file describes all visible clones (V(D)J designation,  size for each sample).
It can be opened by any spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc or Excel for further analysis.}

\question{Open again \com{import/export} menu, and click on the
  \com{export bottom graph} button.
This exports the current view of the plot.}

\question{ Select some clones and align them. The alignment can be
  exported with the \com{export aligned fasta} button in the
  \com{import/export} menu.}
