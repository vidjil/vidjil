# Docker containers or Plain installation

There are two ways to install and run a Vidjil server:

  - We are developping and deploying since 2018 **Docker containers** to ease the installation and the maintenance.
    These Docker containers are used on the public server (<https://app.vidjil.org>) as well as in some partner hospitals.
    We recommend this installation for new instances of Vidjil.
    We also provide support and remote maintenance
    of such in-hospital servers through
    the [VidjilNet consortium](http://www.vidjil.net/index.en.html).

  - The **plain installation of the server** should run on any Linux/Unix server with Nginx (recommanded) or Apache.
    We provide below detailed instructions for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
    We used this installation on the public server between 2014 and 2018.

# Requirements

## CPU, RAM

### Minimal

vidjil-algo typically uses
approx. 1.2GB of RAM to run on a 1GB `.fastq` and will take approx. 5+ minutes.
Therefore in order to process requests from a single user with a few samples,
any standard multi-core processor with 2GB RAM will be enough.

### Recommended

When choosing hardware for your server it is important to know the scale
of usage you require.
If you have many users that use the app on a daily basis, you will need to
have multiple cores to ensure the worker queues don't build up.
One worker will occupy one core completely when running vidjil-algo (which is
currently single-threaded).

For reference, here are various setups of our public
testing server <https://app.vidjil.org>:


#### 2016 -- 2017 (40+ users, including 15 regular users)
  - Processor: Quad core Intel 2.4MHz
  - 3 workers
  - RAM: 16GB


#### since 2018  (100+ users, including 30+ regular users)
  - Virtual Machine: 8 virtual CPUs
  - 6 workers
  - RAM: 28GB
  
  
We create less workers for executing Vidjil-algo than there are (virtual) CPU availabe,
keeping always one CPU core dedicated to the web server, even when the workers run at full capacity.
Running other RepSeq programs through the Vidjil server may require additional CPU and RAM.

## Storage

### Full upload of sequences

As for many high-throughput sequencing pipeline, **disk storage to store input data (`.fastq`, `.fasta`, `.fastq.gz` or `.fasta.gz`)
is now the main constraint** in our environment.

Depending on the sequencer, files can weigh several GB.
Depending of the number of users, a full installation's total storage should thus be serveral hundred GB, or even several TB
(as of the end of 2018, 4 TB for the public server).
We recommend a RAID setup of at least 2x2TB to allow for user files and at least one backup.

User files (results, annotations) as well as the metadata database are quite smaller
(as of the end of 2016, on the public server, 3 GB for all user files of 40+ users).
Note that even when the input sequences are deleted, the server is still able to display the results of previous analyses.

### Remote access on a mounted filesystem

Moreover, it is possible to access `.fastq` files on a mounted filesystem.
See `FILE_SOURCE` below.

## Authentication

The accounts are now local to the Vidjil server.
We intend to implement some LDAP access at some point of 2020.

## Network

Once installed, the server can run on a private network.
However, the following network access are recommended:

  - outbound access
      - for users: several features using external platforms (IgBlast, IMGT/V-QUEST…)
      - for server mainteners: upgrades and reports to a monitor server
  - inbound access
      - through the VidjilNet consortium (http://www.vidjil.net),
        the team in Lille may help local server mainteners in some monitoring, maintenance and upgrade tasks,
        provided a SSH access can be arranged, possibly over VPN.


# Docker -- Installation

All our images are hosted on DockerHub in the [vidjil/](https://hub.docker.com/r/vidjil) repositories.
The last images are tagged with `vidjil/server:latest` and `vidjil/client:latest`.

Individual services are started by docker-compose  (<https://docs.docker.com/compose/>).


## Before installation

Install `docker-compose`. See <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose>

If it doesn't exist yet, you should create a `docker` group.
The users needing to access `docker` must belong to this group.

Install `git`.
Clone the [Vidjil git](https://gitlab.inria.fr/vidjil/vidjil) with `git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/vidjil/vidjil.git`,
and go to the directory [vidjil/docker](https://gitlab.inria.fr/vidjil/vidjil/tree/dev/docker).
This contains both [docker-compose.yml](http://gitlab.vidjil.org/blob/dev/docker/docker-compose.yml) as well as configuration files.

## Docker environment

The vidjil Docker environment is managed by `docker-compose`, who launches the following services:

From image `vidjil/client`

  - `nginx` The web server, containing the client web application

From image `vidjil/server`

  - `mysql` The database
  - `uwsgi` The Web2py backend server
  - `workers` The Web2py Scheduler workers in charge of executing vidjil users' samples

  - `fuse` The XmlRPCServer that handles queries for comparing samples
  - `backup` Starts a cron job to schedule regular backups
  - `reporter` A monitoring utility that can be configured to send monitoring information to a remote server
  - `postfix` A mail relay to allow `uwsgi` to send error notifications



## Network usage and SSL certificates

*If you are simply using Vidjil from your computer for testing purposes you can skip the next two steps.*

  - Step 1 : Change the hostname in the nginx configuration `vidjil-client/conf/nginx_web2py`,
    replacing `$hostname` with your FQDN.
  - Step 2 : Edit the `vidjil-client/conf/conf.js`
        change all 'localhost' to the FQDN

*You will need the following step whether you are using locally or not.*

Vidjil uses HTTPS by default, and will therefore require SSL certificates.
You can achieve this with the following steps:

  - Configure the SSL certificates
     - A fast option is to create a self-signed SSL certificate.
       Note that it will trigger security warnings when accessing the client.
       From the `docker/` directory:
       ```
       openssl genrsa 4096 > web2py.key
       openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 1780 -key web2py.key > web2py.crt
       openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -text < web2py.crt
       mkdir -p vidjil-client/ssl
       mv web2py.* vidjil-client/ssl/
      ```

     + If you are using the `postfix` container you may want to generate certificates (using the same process) and place them in `postfix/ssl`.
       The certificates must bear the name of your mail domain (<maildomain>.crt and <maildomain>.key)

  - A better option is to use other certificates, for example by configuring free [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates.
    One solution is to use `certbot` on the host to generate the certificates and to copy them in the right directory so that the container
    can access it. 
    See [Nginx and Let’s Encrypt with Docker](https://medium.com/@pentacent/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71).
    To check the integrity of the host, `certbot` needs to set up a challenge. 
    Thus, Nginx needs to provide specific files that are generated by `certbot`. 
    To do so, you should tell `certbot` to put those files in the `/opt/vidjil/certs` 
    directory (this can be changed in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    You can generate the certificates with the command `certbot certonly --webroot -w /opt/vidjil/certs -d myvidjil.org`. 
    Then 
    ```shell
    cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/vdd.vidjil.org/fullchain.pem vidjil-client/ssl/web2py.crt
    cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/vdd.vidjil.org/privkey.pem vidjil-client/ssl/web2py.key
    ```
    The certificates can be renewed with `certbot renew` but beware to copy the certificates after that.
    Instead of copying the certificates, you may wish to mount `/etc/letsencrypt` in the Docker image as a volume (*eg.* `/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/nginx/ssl`).
    On certificate renewal (with `certbot`), you then need to restart the Nginx server.
    
If necessary, in `docker-compose.yml`, update `nginx.volumes`, line `./vidjil-client/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl`, to set the directory with the certificates.
    The same can be done for the `postfix` container.


If you would prefer to use the vidjil over HTTP (not recommended outside of testing purposes), you can
use the provided configuration files in `docker/vidjil-server/conf` and `docker/vidjil-client/conf`. You will find several files
that contain "http" in their name. Simply replace the existing config files with their HTTP counter-part (for safety reasons, don't
forget to make a backup of any file you replace.)
 
## First configuration and first launch

  - Set the SSL certificates (see above)
  - Change the mysql root password and the web2py admin password in `docker-compose.yml`
  - Change the mysql vidjil password in `mysql/create_db.sql` and sets it also in `DB_ADDRESS` in `vidjil-server/conf/defs.py`
  - Set the desired mail domain and credentials for the `postfix` container and update `vidjil-server/conf/defs.py`
    `SMTP_CREDENTIALS` and `FROM_EMAIL` to match

  - Comment backup/reporter services in `docker-compose.yml`

  - It is avised to first launch  with `docker-compose up mysql`.
The first time, this container creates the database and it takes some time.

- When `mysql` is launched,
you can safely launch `docker-compose up`.
Then `docker ps` should display five running containers:
`docker_nginx_1`, `docker_uwsgi_1`, `docker_workers_1`, `docker_fuse_1`, `docker_mysql_1`


  - Vidjil also need germline files.
      - You can use IMGT germline files if you accept IMGT licence.
        For this, from the `vidjil` directory (root of the git repository),
        run `make germline` to create `germline/` while checking the licence.
      - These germlines are included in the server container with a volume in the fuse block
        in your `docker-compose.yml`: `../germline:/usr/share/vidjil/germline`.
      - Copy also the generated `browser/js/germline.js` into the `docker/vidjil-client/conf/` directory.


  - Open a web browser to `https://localhost`, or to your FQDN if you configured it (see above).
Click on `init database` and create a first account by entering an email.
This account is the main root account of the server. Other administrators could then be created.
It will be also the web2py admin password.

*notice* : By default, Nginx HTTP server listens for incoming connection and binds on port 80 on the host, if you encounter the following message error:
```
ERROR: for nginx
Cannot start service nginx: driver failed programming external
connectivity on endpoint docker_nginx_1
(236d0696ed5077c002718541a9703adeee0dfac66fb880d193690de6fa5c462e):
Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:80: bind: address already in use
```

You can resolve it either by changing the port used by Vidjil in the `nginx.ports`
section of the `docker-compose.yml` file or by stopping the service using port
80.

  

## Further configuration

The following configuration files are found in the `vidjil/docker` directory:

  - `conf/conf.js` various variables for the vidjil browser
  - `conf/defs.py` various variables for the vidjil server
  - `conf/gzip.conf` configuration for gzip in nginx
  - `conf/gzip_static.conf` same as the previous but for static resources
  - `conf/uwsgi.ini`   configuration required to run vidjil with uwsgi
  - `sites/nginx` configuration required when running vidjil with nginx
  - `scripts/nginx-entrypoint.sh` entrypoint for the nginx
  - `service` (not currently in use)
  - `scripts/uwsgi-entrypoint.sh` entrypoint for the uwsgi
service. Ensures the owner of some relevant volumes are correct within
the container and starts uwsgi

Here are some notable configuration changes you should consider:

  -  mysql root password (`mysql.environment` in `docker-compose.yml`),  mysql vidjil password (`docker-compose.yml` and  `vidjil-server/conf/defs.py`),
     as mentionned above

  - Change the `FROM_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_EMAILS` variables in `vidjil-server/conf/defs.py`.
    They are used for admin emails monitoring the server an reporting errors.

  - To allow users to select files from a mounted volume,
    set `FILE_SOURCE` and `FILE_TYPES` in `vidjil-server/conf/defs.py`.
    In this case, the `DIR_SEQUENCES` directory will be populated with links to the selected files.
    Users will still be allowed to upload their own files.

  - By default all files that
    require saving outside of the containers (the database, uploads, vidjil
    results and log files) are stored in `/opt/vidjil`.
    This can be changed in the `volumes` in `docker-compose.yml`.
    this by editing the paths in the volumes.
    See also <a href="#storage">Requirements / Storage</a> above.

  - Configure the reporter. Ideally this container should be positioned
    on a remote server in order to be able to report on a down server,
    but we have packed it here for convenience.
    You will also
    need to change the `DB_ADDRESS` in `conf/defs.py` to match it.



# Docker -- Adding external software

Some software can be added to Vidjil for pre-processing or even processing if the
software outputs data compatible with the `.vidjil` or AIRR format.
We recommend you add software by adding a volume to your `docker-compose.yml`.
By default we add our external files to `/opt/vidjil` on the host machine. You can then
reference the executable in `vidjil-server/conf/defs.py`.

When the software has compatible inputs and outputs, it will be enough
to configure then the appropriate `pre process` or `analysis config` (to be documented).
In some cases, using the software may require development such as wrappers.
Contact us (<mailto:contact@vidjil.org>) to have more information and help.

# Docker -- Troubleshooting

##  Error "Can't connect to MySQL server on 'mysql'"

The mysql container is not fully launched. This can happen especially at the first launch.
You may relaunch the containers.

If restarting the containers does not resolve the issue, there are a couple of things
you can look into:

 - Ensure the database password in `vidjil-server/conf/defs.py` matches the password for
 the mysql user: `vidjil`.
 If you are not sure, you can check with the following:
 ```sh
 docker exec -it docker_mysql_1 bash
 mysql -u vidjil -p vidjil
 ```
 or reset it:
 ```sh
 docker exec -it docker_mysql_1 bash
 mysql -u root -p
 SET PASSWORD FOR vidjil = PASSWORD('<new password>');
 ```
 
 - Ensure the database was created correctly. This should have been done automatically,
 but just in case, you can check the console output, or check the database:
 ```sh
 docker exec -it docker_mysql_1 bash
 mysql -u vidjil -p vidjil
 ```
 If the database does not exist, mysql will display an error after logging in.

## Launching manually the backup

The backup should be handled by the backup container. If so, connect to this
container and run (for a full backup, otherwise add the `-i` option when
running `backup.sh`):

```sh
cd /usr/share/vidjil/server
sh backup.sh vidjil /mnt/backup >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
```

## I can't connect to the web2py administration site
The URL to this site is https://mywebsite/admin/default/.
The password should be given in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
Otherwise a random password is generated. You can still modify
this password by connecting to the server (in the `uwsgi` container).
Go in the the `/usr/share/vidjil/server/web2py` directory and then
launch Python.
```python
from gluon.main import save_password
save_password(PASSWORD, 443)
```
This password will not persist when the container will be restarted.
For a persistent password, please use the environment variable.

# Docker -- Updating a Docker installation

## Before the update

We post news on image updates at <http://gitlab.vidjil.org/tree/dev/docker/CHANGELOG>.
Check there whether the new image require any configuration change.

By security, we please you to always make a backup (see "Backups", below) before doing this process.
It is especially important to backup the database, as the update process may transform it.

## Pulling the new images

``` bash
docker pull vidjil/server:latest
docker pull vidjil/client:latest
```

This will pull the latest version of the images.
More tags are available at <https://hub.docker.com/r/vidjil/server/tags/>.

If you do not have access to `hub.docker.com` on your server, then you
should pull and extract the image onto a machine that does,
send it to your server with your favourite method, and finally import
the image on the server.

Extract:
``` sh
docker save -o <output_file> vidjil/server[:<version>] vidjil/client[:<version>]
```

Import:
```sh
docker load -i <input_file>
```

## Launch the new containers

In some cases, you may need to update your `docker-compose.yml` file or some
of the configuration files. We will describe the changes in the `CHANGELOG` file.
The latest versions of these files are available on our
[Gitlab](http://gitlab.vidjil.org/).

Once the images are pulled, you can relaunch the containers:
```sh
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

By default, all previous volumes will be reused and no data will be lost.
If the database schema was updated, web2py will update it on your database.
Check that the containers run well, and that you still manage to log on Vidjil
and to access the database, and to see a result from a sample.

If something is not working properly, you have still the option to rollback
to the previous images (for example by tagging as `latest` a previous image),
and possibly by reusing also your last databse backup if something went wrong.

### Launching a single container

When an update occurs on a single container, one may not want to relaunch all
the containers, to save time. With `docker-compose` it is possible to do so.

Stop the desired container (for instance the client):
```
docker-compose stop nginx
```

Then launch it again

```
docker-compose up -d nginx
```

## Knowing what docker image version is running

As our latest image is always tagged `latest` you may have troubles to know
what version is currently running on your server. To determine that, you can
use the *digest* of the image. You can view it, for example with `docker image
--digests vidjil/server`. Then you can compare it with the digests shown [on
the Dockerhub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/vidjil/server/tags/).

# Plain server installation

This installation is not supported anymore.
We rather advise to use the Docker containers (see above).

## Requirements (for Ubuntu 16.04)

``` bash
apt-get install git
apt-get install g++
apt-get install make
apt-get install unzip
apt-get install python-dev python-pip
apt-get install libyajl2 libyajl-dev
pip install unittest2
pip install unittest-xml-reporting
pip install enum34
pip install ijson cffi
```

## Server installation and initialization

Enter in the `server/` directory.

If you just want to do some tests without installing a real web server,
then launch `make install_web2py_standalone`. In the other case, launch
`make install_web2py`.


## Detailed manual server installation and browser linking

Requirements:
ssh, zip unzip, tar, openssh-server, build-essential, python, python-dev,
mysql, python2.5-psycopg2, postfix, wget, python-matplotlib, python-reportlab,
python-enum34, mercurial, git

If you want to run Vidjil with an Apache webserver you will also need:
apache2, libapache2-mod-wsgi

Or if you want to use Nginx:
nginx-full, fcgiwrap

For simplicity this guide will assume you are installing to `/home/www-data`

Clone <https://github.com/vidjil/vidjil.git>

Download and unzip web2py. Copy the contents of web2py to the server/web2py
folder of you Vidjil installation
(in this case /home/www-data/vidjil/server/web2py) and give ownership to www-data:

``` bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /home/www-data/vidjil
```

If you are using apache, you can run the following commands to make sure all the apache modules you need
are activated:

``` bash
a2enmod ssl
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod proxy_http
a2enmod headers
a2enmod expires
a2enmod wsgi
a2enmod rewrite  # for 14.04
```

In order to setup the SSL encryption a key to give to apache. The safest option
is to get a certicate from a trusted Certificate Authority, but for testing
purposes you can generate your own:

``` bash
mkdir /etc/<webserver>/ssl
openssl genrsa 1024 > /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.key
chmod 400 /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.key
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key
    /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.key > /etc/apache2/ssl/self_signed.cert
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -text <
    /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.cert > /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.info
```

\<webserver\> should be replaced with the appropriate webserver name
(ie. apache2 or nginx)

Given that Vidjil is a two-part application, one that serves routes from a server
and one that is served statically, we need to configure the apache to do so.
Therefore we tell the apache to:

  - Start web2py as a wsgi daemon (allows apache to serve the application).
  - Reserve two virtual hosts (one to be served with ssl encryption, and one not).
  - We configure the first host to serve static content and prevent overriding
    by the sever (otherwise all routes are redirected through web2py) and to follow symlinks
    this allows us to symlink to our browser app in the /var/www directory and keep both parts
    of Vidjil together.
  - The second is set to use SSL encryption, and only serve very specific folders statically (such
    as javascript files and images because we don't want to create a controller to serve that kind of data)

you can replace your apache default config with the following
(/etc/apache2/sites-available/default.conf - remember to make a backup just in case):

``` example
WSGIDaemonProcess web2py user=www-data group=www-data processes=1 threads=1

<VirtualHost *:80>

  DocumentRoot /var/www
  <Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None

    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    Options +ExecCGI
    #AllowOverride None

    AddHandler cgi-script cgi pl
  </Directory>

  <Directory /home/www-data/vidjil/browser>
    AllowOverride None

    AllowOverride None
    Require all denied
    <Files wsgihandler.py>
      Require all granted
    </Files>
  </Directory>

  AliasMatch ^/([^/]+)/static/(?:_[\d]+.[\d]+.[\d]+/)?(.*) \
        /home/www-data/vidjil/server/web2py/applications/$1/static/$2

  <Directory /home/www-data/vidjil/server/web2py/applications/*/static/>
    Options -Indexes
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 hour"
    Require all granted
  </Directory>

  CustomLog /var/log/apache2/ssl-access.log common
  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
</VirtualHost>
```

Now we want to activate some more apache mods:

``` bash
a2ensite default                   # FOR 14.04
a2enmod cgi
```

Restart the server in order to make sure the config is taken into account.

And create some symlinks to avoid splitting our app:

``` bash
ln -s /home/www-data/vidjil/browser /var/www/browser
ln -s /home/www-data/vidjil/browser/cgi/align.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin
ln -s /home/www-data/vidjil/germline /var/www/germline
ln -s /home/www-data/vidjil/data /var/www/data
```

If you are using Nginx, the configuration is the following:

``` example
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name \$hostname;
    return 301 https://\$hostname$request_uri;

}

        }

}
```

We also do not create symlinks since all references are managed
correctly.

Now we need to configure the database connection parameters:

  - create a file called conf.js in /home/www-data/vidjil/browser/js containing:
    
    ``` example
    var config = {
        /*cgi*/
        "cgi_address" : "default",
    
        /*database */
        "use_database" : true,
        "db_address" : "default",
    
        "debug_mode" : false
    }
    ```

This tells the browser to access the server on the current domain.

  - copy vidjil/server/web2py/applications/vidjil/modules/defs.py.sample
    to vidjil/server/web2py/applications/vidjil/modules/defs.py
    and change the value of DB<sub>ADDRESS</sub> to reference your database.

You can now access your app.
All that is left to do is click on the init database link above the login page.
This creates a default admin user: plop@plop.com and password: 1234 (make sure to
remove this user in your production environment) and creates the configurations you can have
for files and results.

# Testing the server

If you develop on the server, or just want to check if everything is ok, you
should launch the server tests.

First, you should have a working fuse server by launching `make
  launch_fuse_server` (just launch it once, then it is running in the
background and can be killed with `make kill_fuse_server`).

Then you can launch the tests with `make unit`.

# Troubleshootings

## Web2py runs but does not allow any connection

Check whether the relevant disks are properly mounted.
Disks failures or other events could have triggered a read-only partition.

## Jobs stay in `QUEUED`, workers seem to be stuck

For some reasons, that are not clear yet, it may happen that workers are not
assigned any additional jobs even if they don't have any ongoing jobs.

In such a (rare) case, it may be useful to restart web2py schedulers
with `service web2py-scheduler restart` or `initctl restart web2py-scheduler`
depending on your installation.


## Debugging Web2py workers

One can launch the workers by hand (see in the `/etc/init` script and add a
`-D 0` option. It prints debugging information on what the workers are doing.

The most useful information are from the TICKER worker: the one that
assigns jobs to workers. So you'd better first kill all the workers and
then launch one by hand to be sure that it will be the ticker.

## Restarting web2py

Just touch the file `/etc/uwsgi/web2py.ini`.

Another of restarting it is by touching the file
`server/web2py/applications/vidjil/modules/defs.py`.
This will tell `uwsgi` to restart web2py (including the workers).

## Restarting uwsgi

When one modifies an uwsgi config file (usually in `/etc/uwsgi` directory, it
may be necessary to restart uwsgi so that the modifications are taken into
account. This can be done using

``` bash
initctl restart uwsgi-emperor
```

## Logging database queries

### MySQL

One can see some [insightful SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/650238/how-to-show-the-last-queries-executed-on-mysql).
To summarize, this can either be done at runtime:

``` sql
SET GLOBAL log_output = "FILE";
SET GLOBAL general_log_file = "/path/to/your/logfile.log";
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
```

Or directly in the configuration file (less recommended):

``` conf
general_log_file        = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log
general_log             = 1
```

In that case the server must be restarted afterwards.

# Running the server in a production environment

## Introduction

When manipulating a production environment it is important to take certain
precautionnary mesures, in order to ensure production can either be rolled
back to a previous version or simply that any encurred loss of data can be
retrieved.

Web2py and Vidjil are no exception to this rule.

## Making backups

The top priority is to backup *files created during the analysis*
(either by a software or a human).
Should the data be lost, valuable man-hours would be lost.
In order to prevent this, we make twice a day incremental backups of the
data stored on the public Vidjil servers.

This does not apply to uploaded files. We public servers that they should
keep a backup of their original sequence files.

To ease the backup, the `backup.sh` script provides an example.  For this
script to be ran automatically, it is required that `mysqldump` does not ask
for a password. The credentials informations should be provided in a `~/.my.cnf` file (in the case of MySQL).

``` conf
[client]
user = backup
password = "strongpassword"
host = localhost
```
It is also advised that the backup user has a read-only access to the database.


## Autodelete and Permissions

Web2py has a handy feature called `AutoDelete` which allows the administrator
to state that file reference deletions should be cascaded if no other
references to the file exist.
When deploying to production one needs to make sure `AutoDelete` is
deactivated.
This is the case for the default Vijdil installation (see `server/web2py/applications/vidjil/models/db.py`).

As a second precaution it is also wise to temporarily restrict web2py's
access to referenced files.

Taking two mesures to prevent file loss might seem like overkill, but
securing data is more important than the small amount of extra time spent
putting these mesures into place.

# Plain server installation -- updating the server

**(information to be updated)**

Currently deploying changes to production is analogous to merging into the
rbx branch and pulling from the server.

Once this has been done, it is important that any database migrations have
been applied.
This can be verified by refreshing the server (calling a controller) and
then looking at the database.

## Step by Step

  - Check permissions on the uploads folder (set to 100)
      - you can also check the amount of files present at this point for future
        reference
  - Backup database: Archive old backup.csv and then from admin page: backup
    db
  - pull rbx (if already merged dev)
  - Check the database (for missing data or to ensure mmigrations have been
    applied)
  - Check files to ensure no files are missing
  - Reset the folder permissions on uploads (755 seems to be the minimum
    requirement for web2py)
  - Run unit tests (Simply a precaution: Continuous Integration renders this
    step redundant but it's better to be sure)
  - Check site functionnality

# Resetting user passwords

Currently there is not easy way of resetting a user's password.
The current method is the following:
```bash
cd server/web2py
python web2py -S vidjil -M db.auth_user[<user-id>].update_record(password=CRYPT(key=auth.settings.hmac_key)('<password>')[0],reset_password_key='')
```

# Migrating Data


Usually, when extracting data for a given user or group, the whole database should not be
copied over.
The `migrator` script allows the selective export and import of data,
whether it be a single patient/run/set or a list of them, or even all the sample sets
associated to a group (or to a user).
The script takes care both of database, but also of results and analysis files (see below for sequence files).

See `server/web2py/applications/vidjil/scripts/migrator.py --help`

## Exporting an archive

(to be detailed)

## Importing an archive

### Step 1 : extract the archive on your server

The export directory must be on your server and accessible from your vidjil-server docker container.
You can define a new shared volume; or simply put the export directory on an already accessible location such as  `[DOCKER DIRECTORY]/vidjil-server/conf/export/`

### Step 2 : prepare the group that will own the data

The permissions on a vidjil server are *group* based. Users and groups may be different from one server to another one. Before importing data on a server, one must have a group ready to receive the permissions to manage the imported files.

From the admin web interface has, you can create a new group  ("groups" -> "+new group" -> "add group"). The group ID is displayed between parenthesis next to its name on the group page, you will need it later. If you create such a group on a blank vidjil server, the ID is *4*.

### Step 3 : prepare your server analysis configs

*This step may require bioinformatics support depending on your data, the config previously used, and the ones you intend to use on your new installation. We can offer support via the [VidjilNet consortium](http://www.vidjil.net) for help on setting that.*

Vidjil analysis configs should not be directly transferred between servers. Indeed, they depend on the setup of each server setup (software, paths...) and can collide with existing configs on your installation. Before importing, you thus need to create the missing analysis configs on your server and edit the `config.json` file provided in the export folder.

This `config.json` file initially contains a list of the analysis configs from the original public server, such as:

```
  "2": {
      "description": [
        "IGH",
        "vidjil",
        "-c clones -3 -z 100 -r 1 -g germline/homo-sapiens.g:IGH,IGK,IGL,TRA,TRB,TRG,TRD -e 1 -w 50 -d -y all",
        "-t 100 -d lenSeqAverage",
        "multi-locus"
      ],
      "link_local": 6
  },
```

- `"2"`           :  the original config ID on the server from which the data was exported
- `"description"` :  the original config parameters (only for information, they are ignoed in the import)
- `"link_local"`  :  the config ID that will be used on the new server

In the `config.json` file, you have to replace all` link_local` values with the corresponding config ID
of a similar config on your server (if you don't have a similar one you should create one).

If you much of your imported data was on `old` configs, that you do not intend to run anymore,
a solution is to create a generic `legacy` config for these old data.

Below is an example of such a `config.json`, linking actual configuration on the public >app.vidjil.org> server to configs to a newly installed server.
This should be completed by a mapping of other configs that were used in the migrated data.

```
{
  "2": {
    "description": [ "IGH", "vidjil",  "-c clones -3 -z 100 -r 1 -g germline/homo-sapiens.g:IGH,IGK,IGL,TRA,TRB,TRG,TRD -e 1 -w 50 -d -y all", "-t 100 -d lenSeqAverage",  "multi-locus" ],
    "link_local": 6
  },
  "25": {
    "description": [ "multi+inc+xxx",  "vidjil",  "-c clones -3 -z 100 -r 1 -g germline/homo-sapiens.g -e 1 -2 -d -w 50 -y all",  "-t 100 -d lenSeqAverage",  "default: multi-locus, with some incomplete/unusual/unexpected recombinations"
    ],
    "link_local": 2
  },
  "26": {
    "description": [ "multi+inc", "vidjil", "c clones -3 -z 100 -r 1 -g germline/homo-sapiens.g -e 1 -d -w 50",  "-t 100",  "multi-locus, with some incomplete/unusual recombinations" ],
    "link_local": 3
  },
  "30": {
    "description": [
      "TRG", "vidjil", "-c clones -3 -z 100 -r 1 -g germline/homo-sapiens.g:TRG -y all", "-t 100 -d lenSeqAverage", "TRG, VgJg"
    ],
    "link_local": 5
  },
  "32": {
    "description": [ "multi", "vidjil", "-c clones -3 -z 100 -r 1 -g germline/homo-sapiens.g:IGH,IGK,IGL,TRA,TRB,TRG,TRD -e 1 -w 50 -d -y all", "-t 100 -d lenSeqAverage", "multi-locus" ],
    "link_local": 4
  }
}
```



### Step 4 : prepare your server pre-process configs

Proceed as in step 3 for pre-process configs. The file to edit is named `pprocess.json`.


### Step 5 : import

The import takes place inside the vidjil-server container
```sh
docker exec -it docker_uwsgi_1 bash
cd usr/share/vidjil/server/web2py/applications/vidjil/scripts/
sh migrator.sh -p [RESULTS DIRECTORY] -s [EXPORT DIRECTORY] import --config [CONFIG.JSON FILE] --pre-process [PPROCESS.JSON FILE] [GROUP ID]
```

- [RESULTS DIRECTORY]          the results directory path inside the container, it should be defined in your docker-compose.yml, by default it is /mnt/result/results/
- [EXPORT DIRECTORY]        the export directory you installed in step 1, if you set it up in docker/vidjil-server/conf/export/ is location inside the container should be /etc/vidjil/export/
- [CONFIG.JSON FILE]         this file is located in the export folder and you should have edited it during step 3
- [PPROCESS.JSON FILE]         this file is located in the export folder and you should have edited it during step 4
- [GROUP ID]                         ID of the group you should have created/selected during step 2

Usually, the command is thus:
```
sh migrator.sh -p /mnt/result/results/ -s /etc/vidjil/export/XXXX/ import --config/etc/vidjil/exportXXXX/config.json --pre-process /etc/vidjil/export/XXXX/pprocess.json  4
```



## Exporting/importing input sequence files

Note that web2py and the Vidjil server are robust to missing *input* files.
These files are not backuped and may be removed from the server at any time.
Most of the time, these large files won't be migrated along with the database, the results and the analysis files.

However, they can simply be copied over to the new installation. Their filenames
are stored in the database and should therefore be accessible as long as
they are in the correct directories.



## Exporting/importing a full database

When a full database migration is needed, it can be done with the following command:

``` bash
mysqldump -u <user> -p <db> -c --no-create-info > <file>
```

The `--no-create-info` option is important because web2py needs to be allowed to create tables itself.
Indeed, it keeps track of database migrations and errors will occur if
tables exist which it considers it needs to create.

In order to import the data into an installation you first need to ensure
the tables have been created by Web2py this can be achieved by simply
accessing a non-static page.

/\!\\ If the database has been initialised from the interface you will
likely encounter primary key collisions or duplicated data, so it is best
to skip the initialisation altogether.

Once the tables have been created, the data can be imported as follows:

``` bash
mysql -u <user> -p <db> < <file>
```

At least the results and analysis files should thus be copied.

Please note that with this method you should have at least one admin user
that is accessible in the imported data. Since the initialization is being
skipped, the usual admin account won't be present.
It is also possible to create a user directly from the database although
this is not the recommended course of action.


# Using CloneDB [Under development]
The [CloneDB](https://gitlab.inria.fr/vidjil/clonedb) has to be installed
independently of the Vidjil platform.

Then one can easily extract data to be used with CloneDB. A script is provided
(`server/web2py/applications/vidjil/scripts/create_clone_db.py`) which
produces a FASTA file to be indexed with CloneDB. This script takes as
parameter the FASTA output file and one (or many) group IDs, which correspond
to the groups having access to the datasets. Note that for the moment the Vidjil platform only allow a per group access to the CloneDB.

The FASTA output filename must follow the format `clonedb_XXX.fa` where `XXX`
is replaced with the group ID.

Make sure that the `DIR_CLONEDB` variable is set in `defs.py` and points to
the CloneDB server directory. Make sure that in this directory the
`clonedb_defs.py` has been filled correctly.

Then index the created FASTA file with the CloneDB index (follow the
instructions from CloneDB).
