**[Vidjil](http://www.vidjil.org) is an open-source platform for the analysis of high-throughput
sequencing data from lymphocytes.** [V(D)J recombinations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\(D\)J_recombination) in lymphocytes are
essential for immunological diversity. They are also useful markers of
pathologies, and in leukemia, are used to quantify the minimal residual
disease during patient follow-up.
With adapted [library preparation and sequencing](locus.md),
high-throughput sequencing (NGS/HTS) now
enables the deep sequencing of a lymphoid population with dedicated
sequencing methods and software, called either Rep-Seq or AIRR-Seq.

### Further developer documentation

These documentations and additional developer and maintainer documentation
are available from the [doc/](http://gitlab.vidjil.org/tree/master/doc) directory in the source files,
including development notes on Vidjil-algo (`dev-algo.md`), on the germlines (`dev-germline.md`),
on the web application client (`dev-client.md`), and on the server (`dev-server.md`).
