    Are you sure you want to delete this sequence file?</br>

      You have the choice:
    <dl>
      <dt>delete sequence alone</dt>
      <dd>
	You will remove the file containing all the DNA sequences.
	This will save disk space but you will still have access to your results.
      </dd>
      <dt>delete sequence and results</dt>
      <dd>
	You will remove everything related with this sequence file: the sequence file itself as well as the {{=count_results}} files that have been generated.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    {{else:}}
      {{if delete_results:}}
      You are about to delete the sequence file and {{=count_results}} result files.
      {{else:}}
      You are about to delete the sequence file alone.
